Emathbooks
==========

What?
-----
This repository contains three different types of empty ebooks:
authorbook, studentbook and teacherbook.

Authorbook is a version used to write textbooks and needs connection to a authorserver.

Studentbook and teacherbook are coursebooks for students and teachers respectively.

Each of these contains one html-file (the book itself), mathquill-directory and
data-directory. The html-file contains the ebook reading system, but not any
coursebook.

*These books are not useful as such*, since they don't include any coursebook content and
they don't have connection to any course management system (or author system) at a server.

These files however can be used, if one wants to study, how the system works.

How?
----
The system is basically a TiddlyWiki file with some added functionality.
